* AngularJS rails example2

This example is based on the following tutorial;
http://mightygio.com/2013/03/integrating-rails-and-angularjs-part-1-structure/

It includes
- Rails 3.2.x
- AngularJS 1.0.7
- coffeescript
- Jasmine 
- angular-resources
- HTML5 pushState
- Some best practices

I build upon Mightygio's tutorial with some controller tests.
