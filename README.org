* AngularJS rails best practices

This example is based on the following tutorial;
http://mightygio.com/2013/03/integrating-rails-and-angularjs-part-1-structure/

It includes
- Rails 3.2.x
- AngularJS 1.0.7
- coffeescript
- Jasmine 
- angular-resources
- HTML5 pushState
- Some best practices
- Some tests
- Backend search 
- Using a service to retain search values

I build upon Mightygio's tutorial with some controller tests.
** TODO Improvements

- [ ] Slim down controller and split into individual files
- [ ] Cache search results in a way which will include new/edited results
- [ ] Put search criteria into URL so people can reload search results, or book mark them?
