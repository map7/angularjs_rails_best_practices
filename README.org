This example is based on the following tutorial;

It includes
- Rails 3.2.x
- AngularJS 1.0.7
- coffeescript
- Jasmine 
- angular-resources
- HTML5 pushState
- Some best practices
- Some tests
- Backend search 
- Using a service to retain search values

I build upon Mightygio's tutorial with some controller tests.
